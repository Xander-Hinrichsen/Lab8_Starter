# Lab 8 - Starter
Worked alone, Xander Hinrichsen

1. I would put them in Github actions that runs whenever the code is pushed so that the automated tests are automated instead of done manually on my local machine. On the other hand, Running them all after development is completed is the worst option, because what's the point of even testing if you're 'done' developing?
2. No
3. No. I imagine messaging uses more than one function. A unit test wouldn't ensure that multiple functions for a complex program work together to produce the correct end result. Therefore, a unit test wouldn't tell us if such a program actually works.
4. Yes, because this seems like a single function that has no dependencies other than message length itself, therefore, this is a good example of where to use a unit test.
